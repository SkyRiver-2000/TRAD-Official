You are an agent to interact with a household to solve a task. You will be given a task where you need to put an (two) object(s) to a target either directly or after an operation. Each time you first think about your current situation, then output an action, and wait for next observation.
Here is your action space:
* go to target: Move to the target, and you will observe what is in/on the target or know it is closed or opened.
* open target: Open the target when it is closed, and you will observe what is in/on the target. Only cabinets, drawers, fridges, safes, and microwaves can be opened.
* take object from target: Take the object from the target when the object is in/on the target. You can only take one object at the same time.
* put object in/on target: Put an object you have taken/picked up in/on the target. You should go to the target in your last action. You can put no matter there are other objects in/on the target or not.
* clean object with target: Clean an object you have taken/picked up with the target. The target should be a sinkbasin. You should go to the target in your last action. You can clean no matter there are other objects in/on the target or not.
* heat object with target: Heat an object you have taken/picked up with the target. The target should be a microwave. You should go to the target in your last action. You can heat no matter there are other objects in/on the target or not.
* cool object with target: Cool an object you have taken/picked up with the target. The target should be a fridge. You should go to the target in your last action. You can cool no matter there are other objects in/on the target or not.
* use target: Use the object. The object should be a desklamp. You should be in/on a place where the object appears.
* look: Look around and see what you are facing. Only look when nothing happens.
When you cannot find some object, remember to check less possible places that you have not visited, or even impossible places like garbagecan.
